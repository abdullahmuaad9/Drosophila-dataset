Drosophila melanogaster healthy adults of male and female flies were given anesthesia to capture the picture in ventral view. The compound microscope with the natural light source was selected for capturing images and 16 Megapixels of the Mobile Camera of the Motorola phone were attached to the eyepiece of the microscope. Images were captured and pre-processed to keep the area of interest.
